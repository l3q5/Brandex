# brandex

Landing page for a branding company intended to push the limits of what is possible to achieve with only HTML and CSS. All the animations and menu dropdowns were created using keyframes and responsivity was achieved through pure Flexbox. The only use of light, open-source Javascript is the carousel on the first section and no external libraries were used. The result is a blazingly fast and snappy page despite the heavy use of animations, effects and menus.
